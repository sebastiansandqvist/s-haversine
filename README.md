## About
This module calculates the distance between two points on Earth using lat/long coordinates. It is based on the haversine formula and includes a utility to convert from degrees/minutes/seconds to the signed decimal degrees format needed for the formula to work.

This is great for use with the html5 geolocation api, which provides lat/long coordinates.

## Usage
Get a pair of latitude/longitude coordinates (eg. from the geolocation api), then use them as the arguments for the `distance` method. Example:
```javascript
var haversine = require('s-haversine');

// ---------- [latitude, longitude];
var coords1 = [36.151829, -115.143296];
var coords2 = [36.151465, -115.146284];

haversine.distance(coords1, coords2); // 271.314... (meters)
```

#### Converting deg/min/sec to decimal
This module requires coordinates to be in a signed decimal format. If you have coordinates in degrees/minutes/seconds format, use the `toDecimal` method to convert them. For example, an input such as `40 20 50W` or `40Â°20'50" S` will return roughly `-40.34722`.

```javascript
haversine.toDecimal('40 20 50W'); // -40.34722... (degrees)
```

#### Earth radius
The math involved in the haversine formula depends on knowledge of the Earth's radius. This is configured by default as `6371000` (in meters). If you need to fine tune this or use another radius, you can configure this by setting `haversine.earthRadius` to a number before calling the distance method.
