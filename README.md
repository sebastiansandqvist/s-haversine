## About
This module calculates the distance between two points on Earth using lat/long coordinates. It is based on the haversine formula and includes a utility to convert from degrees/minutes/seconds to the signed decimal degrees format needed for the formula to work.

## Usage
Get a pair of latitude/longitude coordinates (eg. from the geolocation api), then use them as the arguments for the `distance` method. Example:
```javascript
var haversine = require('s-haversine');

var lat1 = 36.151829;
var lon1 = -115.143296;
var lat2 = 36.151465
var lon2 = -115.146284;

haversine.distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2); // 271.314... (meters)
```

Use the `toDecimal` method if your input is in degrees/minutes/seconds format, such as `40 20 50W` or `40Â°20'50" S`. 
```javascript
haversine.toDecimal('40 20 50W'); // -40.34722... (degrees)
```
